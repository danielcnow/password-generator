# Password Generator Starter Code
This project uses Javascript to lead the user through a series of prompts. The length of password and character type is considered in the generation of the password.
This application in particular checks for:
  a value of 8-128 characters
  lower case or 
  upper case characters
  numbers
  and special characters
  
  The application will loop through asking you character types until one is supplied. 
  Then, it can adequately generate a random password.
